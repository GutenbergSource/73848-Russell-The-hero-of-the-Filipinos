<h2>This project is a Second Pass project, meaning it is being cycled through
P1 a second time.</h2>
<p>{P1-&gt;P1} has been added to the titleâ€”all P1ers are
welcome to work on either pass but please work in only one of them so that
each page gets seen by two individuals for the round. Give particular attention to
subtle errors, such as stealth scannos and comma/period errors.</p>
<p style="color:#FF0000;"><b>Please use WordCheck on every page!</b></p>

to view pages you have worked on or to identify users that worked on pages before
you prior to the second pass.</p>

<hr />
A biography of the Philippine National Hero, Jose Rizal. The extra-ordinary story of this gifted person in a book was the first primarily intended for the American public, whereas earlier biographies where mostly available in the Philippines only. The US colonial rules of course also preferred to portray the non-violent and highly intelligent Jose Rizal as a national hero in contrast with the more 'traditional' armed resistance fighters against Spanish (and later American) rule.

<p>No particular difficulties, so have fun!
